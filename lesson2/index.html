## DeFi

### Lesson 2: Money Markets

*Doug Hoyte, March 2021*

[https://is.gd/blockchaindefi](https://is.gd/blockchaindefi)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Lesson Topics

* Time Value of Money
* Leverage
* Case Study: Compound

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Time Value of Money

* Would you rather have <span>$</span>100 right now, or $100 a year from now?
* Correct answer is right now: You could lend that money out and earn interest for the year
* If interest rate is 10%, you'll end up with <span>$</span>110 after a year instead of $100
* This implies that <span>$</span>100 now is equal to $110 a year from now

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Compound Interest

$P'=P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$

* $P$ : Original principal
* $P'$ : New principal
* $r$ : Interest rate
* $n$ : Number of compoundings
* $t$ : Loan duration

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Simple Interest

* Also known as "nominal" interest rate
* Assume we start with 1 dollar ($P=1$) and loan is for 1 year ($t=1$)
* If we have a 5% interest rate and there is only 1 compounding period, we pay or earn exactly 5% interest:

$(1+\frac{0.05}{1})^{1 \times 1}=1.05$

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Semi-Annual Compounding

* Suppose we have 2 compounding periods (each 6 months)

$(1+\frac{0.05}{2})^{2}=1.050625$

* In the first period we earn/pay 2.5% interest on the principal
* In the second period we earn/pay 2.5% interest on the principal *and* the interest from the first payment

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## More Frequent Compounding

* Monthly: $(1+\frac{0.05}{12})^{12}=1.051161897881733$

* Daily: $(1+\frac{0.05}{365})^{365}=1.051267496467463$

* Per second: $(1+\frac{0.05}{365 \times 86400})^{365 \times 86400}=1.051271096334355$

* Continuous: $e^{0.05} = 1.051271096376024$

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Which compounding frequency?

* Lenders prefer more frequent compounding, and borrowers less frequent
* Problem with less frequent compounding: adds edge case incentives where people wait for a compounding interval to pass
* Better to use as high frequency as possible, and adjust nominal rate to compensate

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## On-chain compounding

* Computing $e^x$ in Solidity to high precision is expensive
* Per-second compounding is a sweet spot
  * Seconds are the smallest time unit possible on the EVM
  * Typically within a billionth of a percent of continuous anyway
  * Can be computed with integer exponentiation

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Integer Exponentiation

* Naive (multiply n $x$s together):

$x^n = x \times x \times x \times ... \times x$

* Repeated squaring:

$x^n = x^{\frac{n}{2}} \times x^{\frac{n}{2}} = x^{\frac{n}{4}} \times ... \times x^{\frac{n}{4}} = ... $

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Repeated Squaring in Binary

* Notice in repeated squaring we need to keep halving the exponent until we get down to 1
* Number of halvings is equal to number of bits
* Computers store numbers in binary so exponent is already in the right format for us
  * Just need to loop over the bits in reverse!
* Advanced modern computer algorithm right?
  * Nope: described in Hindu text circa 200 BC

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Interest Accumulators

* In a smart contract, we cannot update each user's balance to pay out interest
* Instead, usual way is to keep an accumulator
  * Multiplicative accumulator: Every update multiply it by the interest accrued since previous update
* Each user's balance is stored along with their own accumulator
  * User's accumulator only updated when their balance changes

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Interest Accumulator Example

1. Accumulator is at `2.1`
1. User A invests 100. State: `(100, 2.1)`
1. Some time passes, and 1% interest accrued
1. Accum update: `2.1 * 1.01 -> 2.121`
1. User B invests 50, State: `(50, 2.121)`
1. More time passes, and 3% interest accrued
1. Accum update: `2.121 * 1.03 -> 2.18463`

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Interest Accumulator Example 2

* User's total balances are their stored balances times how much the asset's accumulator has grown since user's accumulator was snapshotted
  * User A's balance:<br/> `100 * 2.18463 / 2.1 = 104.03`
  * User B's balance:<br/> `50 * 2.18463 / 2.121 = 51.5`

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Leverage

* A common use-case for borrowing is "leverage"
* This means borrowing money and using it to make investments
* Increases profits, but also losses
  * Can be very risky

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Leverage example

1. Borrow $100
1. Use it to buy 10 of token ABC at $10 each
1. ABC goes up to $11
1. Sell your ABC for $110
1. Pay back the $100
1. Profit $10

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Collateral

* Money deposited to secure a loan
* If the lender requires you to put in <span>$</span>10 to borrow $100, then you are 10:1 leveraged
* Price went up 10% but you profited 100%

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="leverage.svg" />

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Collateralised Lending

* On the blockchain, there is no way to repossess tokens transferred to a user
* Such loans must be fully collateralised
  * Typically *over*-collateralized, for safety during big price movements
* When prices move against the borrower, collateral can be sold off to recover borrowed assets
  * "Liquidation"
  * Protects lenders

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Collateral Factor

* In order to ensure that liquidation can happen reliably, there is a safety buffer called a collateral factor
* You can borrow assets worth your collateral's value times its collateral factor
* Example: If DAI's collateral factor is 0.75, and you deposit 1000 DAI, you can borrow up to 750 worth of assets
  * 750 DAI ~= US $750

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Re-supplying Collateral

* If loans must be over-collateralised, how is leverage possible?
* Take example from previous slide:
  * Borrow $750 of ETH, sell it for DAI
  * Deposit that fresh DAI as more collateral
  * Now you have $1750 worth of collateral deposited
  * Can borrow up to `1750 * .75 = 1312.5`
  * Repeat

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Re-supplying Collateral

* You can repeat this until your total DAI collateral is `1000 / (1 - 0.75) = 4000`
* At this point you will have sold $3000 worth of assets, for example ETH
  * You are short ETH/DAI at 3:1 leverage
  * "short" = you want ETH to go down in price, relative to DAI
  * Equivalently, you are "long" DAI/ETH

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Using Flash Loans

Rather than repeat deposits, use a flash loan:

1. Flash borrow 4000 DAI
1. Deposit it as collateral
1. Borrow $3000 worth of ETH
1. Sell this ETH for DAI, giving you 3000 DAI
1. With this 3000 and your original 1000 DAI, pay back the flash loan
  * (ignoring flash loan fees)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Profit Example

Suppose the price of ETH falls: Amount you could buy for 1000 DAI you can now get for only 800:

1. Flash borrow full amount of ETH owed, worth <span>$</span>2400 = $3000 \times \frac{800}{1000}$
1. Pay back all the ETH you owe
1. Withdraw 4000 DAI collateral
1. Convert $2400 worth to ETH, repay flash loan
1. Profit is 600 DAI (3x the 200 you would've earned without leverage)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Loss Example

* Suppose instead the price of ETH rises: Amount you could buy for 1000 DAI you now need 1200:
* The $3000 of ETH is now worth 3600
* Implied collateral factor of 0.9
  * *A violation*!
1. Liquidators seize 3600 DAI of your collateral, sell it for ETH, and give this back to lenders
1. You are left with 400 DAI collateral: 600 DAI loss (3x the 200 loss without leverage)

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Carry Trade

* Where you take advantage of interest rate differences
* Classic example: JPY interest is about 0.1%, AUD interest is 5%
* Borrow JPY and buy AUD, hold for a year
* Earn 5%, paying 0.1%
  * Leverage up to increase profit
* Risk is price movement in JPY/AUD
  * Worse with leverage: No free lunch

## Lending Markets on Ethereum

* MakerDAO: Lets you borrow DAI against ETH collateral. Tries to maintain DAI pegged to US Dollar
* Compound: Borrow/lend ~10 assets. Uses custom off-chain oracle
* AAVE: Borrow/lend ~25 assets. Chainlink oracle
* Euler: Borrow/lend any ERC-20 asset, Uniswap TWAP Oracle (coming soon)

</script></section>







<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Case Study: Compound

* Money market lending protocol
* Live in 2019
* Many billions of dollars worth of "Total Value Locked"
* Respect governance system, using COMP tokens

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Compound Architecture

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="compound.svg" />

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Solidity Inheritance

    contract A {
        function func1() private {}
        function func2() internal {}
    }

    contract B is A {
        // func2 is visible, func1 isn't
    }

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Inherited storage

* The comptroller storage is actually stored in the Unitroller contract
  * The Comptroller code is invoked by `delegatecall`
* When the Comptroller is upgraded, it continues to use the old storage
* Compound is careful to always add new storage variables to the end, and never the middle
  * That would break the storage after an upgrade

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Inheritance Order

* Heirarchy ensures ordering of storage variables

      contract ComptrollerV1Storage {
          uint origVariables;
          ...
      }

      contract ComptrollerV2Storage is ComptrollerV1Storage {
          uint newVariables;
          ...
      }

      contract Comptroller is ComptrollerV2Storage
      }

* Compound released before `abstract` contract feature

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Abstract Contracts

* Usually used for base classes
* Not intended to be instantiated
* Defines an interface for a class
      abstract contract BaseToken {
          function symbol() public virtual returns (string memory);
      }
* Note we didn't provide a function body
* `virtual` means derived classes can override

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Virtual/Override

* Because `BaseToken` didn't implement it, derived contracts *must* implement `symbol()`:
      contract MyToken is BaseToken {
          function symbol() public override returns (string memory) {
              return "SYM";
          }
      }
* `override` means we are overriding a `virtual` method
* Methods can have both `virtual` and `override`, meaning they could in turn be overridden by another class
