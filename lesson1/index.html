## DeFi

### Lesson 1: Prices, Oracles, and Uniswap

*Doug Hoyte, March 2021*

[https://is.gd/blockchaindefi](https://is.gd/blockchaindefi)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Lesson Topics

* Prices and Oracles
* Averages and Accumulators
* Uniswap

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Decentralized Finance

* DeFi: Financial systems built with smart contracts as the platform for enforcing rules, instead of legal system
* The intersection of economics and blockchain technology
* Benefits are: transparent and permissionless

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Social benefit of markets

* Even if you aren't buying or selling, prices are valuable signals
* Trusted, publically visible pricing
  * This is a positive externality of markets
  * Helps people plan economic activity

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Fungible Assets

* Assets where every unit is interchangeable with any other
* You don't care which dollar bill you have, or exactly which share of a company

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Arbitrage

* Way to earn profit if you see the price of a fungible asset is different in two markets
* Simultaneously buy at the lower price and sell at the higher price
  * Difference is risk-free profit

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Arbitrage, 2

* The reason that prices around the world match
  * Example: Price of gold in New York and London
* No coordination required
  * Just assumes self-interested market participants

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Competition or collusion?

<img width="500px" src="gas-stations.jpg">

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Competition or collusion?

* So if you see similar prices, it must be a competitive market right?
* Not necessarily: They could be colluding together to keep the price high
  * Price fixing
  * Cartels

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Marginal Prices

* When you buy in bulk, it's cheaper right?
* Not so on financial markets:
  * There is usually a small amount available at a good price, and more at a worse price
* "Marginal price" is the price for the smallest (maybe infinitesimal) size you can buy

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Prices in Smart Contracts

* Smart contracts often need prices
  * To know a fair cost to charge for a service, or pay for an input
  * Derivatives: Betting whether a price will go up or down
  * Lending systems: Ensure that a loan is collateralized

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Oracles

* Smart contracts only have access to state already on the blockchain, or passed in via a transaction
* "Oracle" is the name for a method that a smart contract uses to get a price

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Off-chain oracles

* Prices are compiled from many sources off-chain, then submitted to the blockchain
* Usually some sort of trusted party signs the prices
* Example: Chainlink

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## LIBOR

* London Inter-bank Offered Rate
* Banks submit their claimed lending costs, which are aggregated into the LIBOR by an association
* 2008 scandal: Banks were manipulating their submissions because they had derivative positions on the LIBOR

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## On-chain Price Feeds

* Rather than taking prices from off-chain markets, can we use the prices from on-chain trading?
* These can provide "objective" prices
  * Driven by arbitrage, not oracles

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Flash Loans

* Imagine you write a cheque to buy something, then you sell it for a profit and receive a new cheque
* As long as you deposit your new cheque before the cheque you wrote clears, you don't need any balance in your account!

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Flash Loans on Ethereum

* On Ethereum, it works like this:
  * A borrower requests a lending contract to send some ETH or tokens
  * The lender sends the tokens, then invokes a callback into the borrower's code
  * When the borrower's callback returns, the lender verifies that the funds were returned (plus fees)

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Example Flash Lender

    function flashLoan(uint amount) {
        uint origBalance = this.balance;

        msg.sender.transfer(amount);

        // Invoke a function on the caller
        IFlashLoan(msg.sender).onFlashLoan();

        // Make sure the function paid us back
        require(this.balance >= origBalance);
    }

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Snapshot Problem

* On-chain prices must be used with care
  * They can often be manipulated
* Attackers can make a big trade to move the price, then call your contract which reads the bad price, then make a trade to move the price back
  * *All within the same transaction*
    * Risk-free
  * Flash loans make this worse: Attackers don't even need capital to do this

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Solution to the snapshot problem

* One solution to the snapshot problem is to not use instantaneous prices
* Instead use the price averaged over some time period
  * Attacker would have to hold the price at a bad level for period of time
  * But attacker is vulnerable to arbitrage while doing this

</script></section>





<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Impulse

Imagine an asset's price is flat, and then spikes up momentarily, and then spikes back down:

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="impulse.svg" />

* This is called an "impulse"

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Moving Average

* If we transform this price data and make every point the average of the previous N points:
 
<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="moving-average-impulse.svg" />

* This is the "impulse response"

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Impulse Response 

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="moving-average-impulse.svg" />

* Suppose N=10
  * Response is 1/10th the height of the impulse
  * After the N points pass, the price level returns to what it was before
    * "Finite Impulse Response"

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Step

Now imagine the price jumps to a new level and stays there:

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="step.svg" />

* This is called a "step"

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Step Response

This is how our moving average responds to a step: 

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="step-response.svg" />

* Step response is the integral of the impulse response

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Features of Moving Averages

* Abrupt changes to the price take some time to be reflected in the average
* After the window elapses, historical prices have no effect on the new prices (FIR)
* Very efficient to compute
  * Recursively

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Recursive computation

Imagine we want to keep an average of the last 10 elements. Keep a running sum:

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="moving-average-recursive.svg" />

* Adding new element just needs 1 subtraction and 1 addition

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Uniswap2 TWAP

* Uniswap 2 works by keeping a running sum of the price
* Every second the current price is added to the sum
  * This sum is known as an "accumulator"
  * Doesn't actually run every second, just simulated when contract is interacted with

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Recursive computation of TWAP

If you have 2 accumulator snapshots, subtract them to get the sum of prices between:

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="moving-average-recursive2.svg" />

* Then divide by the time between snapshots to get average price

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## TWAP Example

Suppose we have the following price movements:

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="uniswap-twap1.svg" />

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## TWAP Example, 2

This is what the accumulator looks like:

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="uniswap-twap2.svg" />

* The higher the price, the steeper the slope of the accumulator

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## TWAP Example, 3

Subtract 2 snapshots to get area:

<img style="background-color: white; border: 0; padding: 40px" src="uniswap-twap3.svg" />

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Geometric Averages

* Another type of moving average uses the product of the prices, and then the nth root
* Advantage: Averages of inverses = inverse of average
  * Uniswap 2 uses normal moving average so has to keep two separate moving averages
  * Uniswap 3 uses geometric so only needs to keep one
* Also matches log-normal price models, which some people use to model trading activity

</script></section>

## Automated Market Makers

* An AMM is a special contract that buys and sells an asset according to specific rules
* Uniswap is most famous example on Ethereum

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Constant Product Rule

* Uniswap has a simple rule: The product of the amounts of the assets is a constant
      x * y = k
* You can swap an amount of token for another amount, but you need to keep the product the same

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Constant Product Rule, 2

* Suppose there are 10 of token A and 4 of token B
      k = 10 * 4 = 40
* The price of A in units of B is
      4 / 10 = 0.4
* The price of B in units of A is
      10 / 4 = 2.5

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Constant Product Rule, 3

* I want to buy exactly 2 units of A so I withdraw 2 A tokens from reserves, leaving 8 A tokens
* How many Bs must there now be?
      8 * B = 40
      B = 40 / 8
      B = 5
* Since B started at 4 tokens I need to deposit 1 unit of B to bring it up to 5

</script></section>



<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Constant Product Rule, 4

* Now there are 8 of token A and 5 of token B
* `k` remains 40 <span style="margin-left: 20px; color: green; font-size: 120%">&check;</span>:
      k = 8 * 5 = 40
* The price of A in units of B goes up:
      5 / 8 = 0.625
* The price of B in units of A goes down:
      8 / 5 = 1.6

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Slippage

* We said the price of A in B was 0.4
* But we paid 1 B for 2 As, meaning price was 0.5
  * 0.4 was the *marginal* price (price for smallest amount possible)
  * The more you buy the worse your average price will be
    * "*slippage*"

</script></section>




<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Decimal Scaling

* In solidity, division is always integer division (truncates decimals)
* Example: `4 ether / 10 ether = 0` (!)
* To get around this, first scale by decimal precision (usually `1e18`):

      function getPriceOfA() external view returns (uint) {
          return reserveB * 1e18 / reserveA;
      }
